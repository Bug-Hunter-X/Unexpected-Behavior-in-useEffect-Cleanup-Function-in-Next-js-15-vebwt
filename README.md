# Unexpected Behavior in useEffect Cleanup Function in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates an unusual issue encountered in Next.js 15 applications involving the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function.  Specifically, the console logs within the cleanup function don't always execute as anticipated when the component unmounts.

The issue seems to be related to [potential reasons, e.g.,  optimistic rendering, hydration mismatch, or specific interactions with other Next.js features].  The provided code reproduces the problem.  The solution explores different approaches to ensure reliable execution of cleanup logic.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Observe the console output.  The cleanup logs might not consistently appear, which is the unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution file demonstrates how to resolve the problem.  This often involves [e.g., using ref for conditional cleanup, or ensuring data dependencies in useEffect are correctly handled].

## Additional Notes

The investigation into this issue revealed potential connection with [explain relevant context such as version of React, Next.js, or related libraries] and highlighted potential pitfalls when working with cleanup functions in complex Next.js applications.  More research is needed to pinpoint the exact root cause and provide a comprehensive solution for all cases.
